# Find LZ4 libraries and headers.
# If found, the following variables will be defined:
# - LZ4_FOUND: System has LZ4.
# - LZ4_INCLUDE_DIRS: LZ4 include directories.
# - LZ4_LIBRARIES: LZ4 libraries.
# - LZ4_DEFINITIONS: Compiler switches required for using LZ4.
#
# In addition, a target LZ4::lz4 will be created with all of
# these definitions.
