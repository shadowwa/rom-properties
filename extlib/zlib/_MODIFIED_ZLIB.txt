This copy of zlib-1.2.11 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Non-CMake build infrastructure has been removed.

- CMakeLists.txt has been edited to prevent building the Win32 resource
  data when being built as a shared library.

- Example binaries are no longer built.

- The OF() and ON() macros have been renamed to _Z_OF() and _Z_ON().
  Based on Gentoo's zlib-1.2.11 patches.

- contrib/ has been stripped of everything but asm-optimized functions.

- 64-bit assembly-optimized routines now check for __x86_64__ in addition
  to __amd64__ for compatibility with certain compilers, e.g. icc.

- CMakeLists.txt now sets the target compile definitions to -DZLIB_CONST
  and sets the target include directories. This allows all targets
  that depend on zlib/zlibstatic to automatically pick up the compile
  definitions and include directories.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Improved shared vs. static selection.
