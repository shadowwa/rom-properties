    Release GoogleTest 1.11.0
    
    PiperOrigin-RevId: 378861756

The following changes have been made to the original:

- Disabled INSTALL() rules.

- Forced static library builds.

- Disabled some options for enabling unit tests and other
  settings that aren't necessary for rom-properties.

- cmake_minimum_required() is disabled, since it interfered with
  policies set by the main build infrastructure.

- Removed test suites, scripts, and Xcode projects in order to reduce
  warnings on LGTM.
