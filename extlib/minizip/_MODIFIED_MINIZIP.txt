commit 46157039728e4220a4f35388c3a9f7a774e7be3a
Version 2.10.0

Tag: 2.10.0

The following changes have been made to the original:

- cmake_minimum_required() has been disabled. The project-wide values
  will be used instead.

- Certain compile definitions are exported as part of the libminizip
  target, since they're needed in order to prevent build errors in
  other projects.

- mz_os_win32.c: #define FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT if it isn't defined.

- Some other functionality not needed by rom-properties has been disabled.
