This copy of inih-r51 is a modified version of the original.

commit 75fe6b1a03d99a9728b9924f9af30729e51357c2
Fix #107 (ugh, I thought changing from strncpy was a bad idea)

Tag: r51

The following changes have been made to the original:

- INI files are opened in binary mode instead of text mode.

- Callback functions have explicit __cdecl annotations to ensure
  they work properly if compiling with 32-bit MSVC using /Gz.
  (default stdcall)

- The Meson build scripts have been removed.
