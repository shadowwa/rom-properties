# MIME types for rom-properties.
# These MIME types do not have thumbnails, so they should only be
# listed in the KDE .desktop files, not the GTK+ .thumbnailer files.

# NOTES:
# - all/all doesn't work; use application/octet-stream.
#   - TODO: Remove application/octet-stream and only use more-specific types?
# - MS CAB is listed for Nintendo Badge Arcade .cab files.
# - model/x.stl-binary and image/x-3ds are listed for Nintendo 3DS files.
# - Non-thumbnailable MIME types are only listed in KDE .desktop files.
